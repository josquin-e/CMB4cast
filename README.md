CMB4cast

This is a forecasting framework for any single or association of CMB instrument(s).
It consists in three parts:
- component separation of large scale diffuse foregrounds following procedure from Errard et al (2011)
- delensing using EB quadratic estimator, CIB or futuristic Large Scale Surveys.
- Fisher estimates of the error bars on the most common cosmological parameters. Error bars include cosmic and noise variance, as well as the effect from statistical foregrounds residuals. 
The code has been illustrated in the results of Errard, Feeney, Peiris Jaffe (2016).

The code is in python.

Librairies needed are :
- camb
- numpy
- matplotlib
- healpy
- scipy
